# Juice Shop Solutions

## Introduction

This repository to show and present how I went about finding solutions through [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/). I plan to write down techniques and thought processes to find the solutions. 
This will be based off of the 3/29/2022 revision. 

## Pre-Requisites

Be on a linux or a mac with docker engine installed. Also, have curl installed as part of commandline and have Google Chrome installed.  

## Getting Started

### Running the docker container
```sh
$ ./start.sh
```

### Stopping the docker container
```sh
$ ./stop.sh
```

## Known Issues
* Progress will be stored as cookies, so if you clear your cookies you will loose progress
* Have a smarter start and stop. All in one script would be nice with a nuke option.
